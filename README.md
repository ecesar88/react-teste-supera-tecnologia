## Getting started

## How to configure

First we need to download and install all the dependencies (i.e libraries);

To do so, head over to the project's folder and inside it

open up a terminal or a Command Prompt window and type in the following:

`yarn` - This will download all the dependencies of the project

And hit `Enter`

After you've done that, we now need to start the application, to do that, you need to run

`yarn start`
